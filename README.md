The User Management application consists of the User Management Console frontend (Vue.js) and User Management Service backend (Spring Boot) and depends on a Keycloak server. Local set-up instructions for each component are in [frontend README](frontend/README.md) and [backend README](backend/README.md).

The MoH Jenkins server handles automated deployment of the application.
